      You should change your pad or tampon every 4 to 6 hours — or sooner if it feels full or uncomfortable.
      If you’re using reusable products like cloth pads or menstrual cups, change or clean them as recommended.
      Changing regularly helps prevent smells, leaks, and infections, and keeps you feeling clean and confident.

      Here are some simple ways to stay clean during your period:
      - Wash your hands before and after changing your pad or tampon.
      - Clean your private parts with warm water every day. You can use a mild, unscented soap if needed.
      - Change your underwear daily and wear breathable cotton if possible.
      - Dispose of used pads or tampons properly — wrap them in tissue and throw them in a bin (not the toilet).
      - Carry a small hygiene kit with extra pads, tissues, and a clean pair of underwear, just in case.

      Taking care of yourself during your period is a great way to stay healthy and feel proud of your growing body!
