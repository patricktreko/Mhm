  - heading: "What is Gender and Support?"
    content: |
      Gender is how people see themselves — like being a girl, a boy, or something else — and it can be different from a person’s body (called their sex).
      Gender roles are ideas that society teaches us about how people “should” act, but everyone is unique and should be accepted just as they are.

      Support means being kind, helpful, and respectful to others — especially during sensitive times like when someone is on their period.
      Everyone, no matter their gender, can learn to support each other.

  - heading: "When Should I Offer Support?"
    content: |
      You should try to be supportive all the time, but especially when someone is going through something challenging — like having their period, feeling unwell, or being teased.
      Even a small act of kindness can make someone feel much better.
      Support isn’t just for friends — it can be for classmates, siblings, or anyone around you.

  - heading: "Why is Support Important?"
    content: |
      Support helps people feel accepted, safe, and cared for.
      When someone is supported, they are less likely to feel embarrassed, stressed, or alone — especially when going through things like periods, puberty, or emotional changes.
      Kindness and understanding make schools and communities better for everyone.

  - heading: "How Can I Support Others?"
    content: |
      Supporting others is simple but powerful. You can:
      - Be kind: Use gentle words and offer to help.
      - Don’t tease or joke about periods or bodies.
      - Listen if someone wants to talk or needs a friend.
      - Respect privacy — don’t point out stains or personal matters.
      - Speak up if you see someone being teased or bullied.

      Whether you're a boy, girl, or non-binary, you can help make the world a kinder place by showing support and respect for others!
