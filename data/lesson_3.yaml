      The menstrual cycle is something that happens every month to people with a uterus.
      It’s your body’s natural way of getting ready to grow a baby one day.
      If no baby is made, the body gently releases the lining of the uterus, which comes out as blood through the vagina.
      This is called a period. It’s a normal and healthy part of growing up.

  - heading: "When Does it Start?"
    content: |
      Most people get their first period between the ages of 10 and 15, but it can start earlier or later — and that's okay!
      Everyone's body is different. Starting early or late doesn’t mean anything is wrong.
      It just means your body is following its own special schedule.

  - heading: "Why Does it Happen?"
    content: |
      The menstrual cycle happens because your body is getting ready to have a baby someday.
      Each month, your uterus builds a soft lining in case an egg gets fertilized and grows into a baby.
      If that doesn’t happen, the body lets go of the lining — and that’s your period.
      It’s part of how your body keeps things working the way they should.

  - heading: "How Long Does it Last?"
    content: |
      The whole menstrual cycle usually takes between 21 to 35 days from start to finish.
      The period part — when blood comes out — often lasts about 3 to 7 days.
      Some people have longer or shorter cycles, especially when they first start, and that’s totally normal too.

      Getting your period can feel new and strange at first, but don’t worry — you’ll learn how to manage it!
      Here are some helpful tips:

      - Use pads or other products: These help keep you comfortable and clean.
      - Change regularly: Change pads every few hours to stay fresh and prevent leaks.
      - Stay clean: Bathe every day and wear clean underwear.

      Remember, having a period is a normal and healthy part of life!
