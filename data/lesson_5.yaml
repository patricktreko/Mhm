      Cycle tracking means keeping a record of your menstrual cycle.
      This includes writing down the first and last days of your period and noticing how you feel during the month.
      You can also track things like cramps, mood changes, or how heavy your period is.
      It's like keeping a diary for your body so you can understand it better.

      It's a good idea to track your cycle every month, starting with the first day your period begins.
      Over time, you might start to notice patterns — like how many days your period lasts or when you usually feel certain symptoms.
      Tracking regularly helps you stay prepared and in tune with your body.

      - You’ll understand how your body feels during different parts of your cycle.
      - If you notice anything unusual, like missing periods or very strong cramps, you can tell a trusted adult or doctor with more information.
