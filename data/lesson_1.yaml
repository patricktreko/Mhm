      Puberty is a time in life when your body starts to change as you grow from a child into a teenager.
      These changes help your body get ready to become an adult. 
      You might grow taller, get stronger, and notice new things happening with your body.
      It's completely normal, and everyone goes through it—just at different times.

  - heading: "When Does Puberty Happen?"
    content: >
      Puberty doesn’t start at the same age for everyone.
      Most girls start between the ages of 8 and 14, and most boys between 9 and 15.
      Some kids start earlier or later, and that’s okay too.
      Your body knows the right time for you to begin, so there’s no need to worry if your friends are changing before or after you.

  - heading: "Why Does Puberty Happen?"
    content: >
      Puberty begins because your brain sends special signals to your body using chemicals called hormones.
      These hormones tell your body to start growing and changing.
      They help you develop things like breasts, facial hair, or a deeper voice depending on your gender.
      It’s like a signal that tells your body, “It’s time to grow up!”

      During puberty, your body goes through many changes.
      You might grow taller, get pimples, sweat more, or start needing to use deodorant.
      Your emotions may change too — you might feel happy one moment and upset the next.
      This is because your body and brain are adjusting.
      You might also notice changes in how you feel about your friends, family, or yourself — and that’s totally normal.

      Puberty can feel confusing, but you’re not alone.
      Here are some ways to make it easier:
      - Talk to a trusted adult like a parent, teacher, or doctor if you have questions.
      - Eat healthy foods and drink lots of water.
      - Get enough sleep so your body has time to grow and rest.
      - Stay clean by bathing regularly and wearing clean clothes.
      - Be kind to yourself — everyone grows at their own pace, and that’s perfectly okay.
