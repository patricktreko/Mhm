      Here’s how to throw away used period products the right way:
      - Wrap the used pad or tampon in toilet paper or the wrapper from your new pad.
      - Place it in a trash bin — never flush it down the toilet, as it can clog pipes and hurt the environment.
      - If there's no trash bin nearby, bring a small bag in your period kit so you can carry it until you find one.
      - Wash your hands after handling used products to keep yourself clean.

      Proper disposal is simple, and it helps everyone stay healthy and comfortable!
