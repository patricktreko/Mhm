      The reproductive system is a special part of your body that helps people have babies when they grow up.
      It's made up of different organs that all work together to help make new life.
      Boys and girls have different reproductive systems, but both are important and help keep the human family going.
      These parts usually start to grow and change during puberty.

      Boys and girls have different body parts that make up their reproductive systems.
      
      In boys, the main parts are:
      - Penis – the part outside the body.
      - Scrotum – the skin that holds the testicles.
      - Testes (or testicles) – where sperm is made.
      - Vas deferens – a tube that carries sperm.

      In girls, the main parts are:
      - Ovaries – where tiny eggs are stored.
      - Fallopian tubes – where the egg travels after leaving the ovary.
      - Uterus – where a baby can grow.
      - Cervix – the opening to the uterus.
      - Vagina – the passage that connects the uterus to the outside of the body.

      These parts all have important jobs, but they don't fully start working until after puberty.

      Learning about it helps us understand how our bodies work and how to take care of them.
