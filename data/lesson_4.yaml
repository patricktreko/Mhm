      PMS stands for Premenstrual Syndrome.
      It’s a group of feelings or changes that some people have before or during their period.
      These changes can be physical (like cramps or tiredness) or emotional (like feeling sad, moody, or easily annoyed).
      Not everyone has PMS, and it can feel different for each person.

      PMS usually starts a few days before your period begins and may continue during the first few days of bleeding.
      Some people feel changes in their body or mood a week before their period, while others might not notice anything at all.
      This is all part of how the body gets ready for a period.

  - heading: "Why Does PMS Happen?"
    content: |
      PMS happens because your body is going through hormonal changes during your menstrual cycle.
      Hormones are special chemicals in your body that help control different things, like growth, energy, and emotions.
      When these hormone levels change before your period, they can affect how you feel — both in your body and your mind.
